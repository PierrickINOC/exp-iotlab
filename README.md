# Quick Starting IoT-LAB experiments

Utilities and scripts for automating experiments with IoT-LAB ( https://www.iot-lab.info ) with different systems.

The idea is to be as simple as possible. The steps:

1) Start installing a virtual machine (with the proper Ubuntu),
  following the instructions:

  * [Installing/Configuring a Virtual Machine](README-vm.md) for IoT-LAB experiments.

2) Automatically launch one of the following experiments:
  
  * [Run a RIOT Experiment](README-RIOT.md)

  * [Run a OpenWSN Experiment](README-OpenWSN.md)

  * [Run a Contiki RPL Experiment](README-Contiki.md) (this was demonstrated at 
IETF 90 [LLN Plugfest](https://bitbucket.org/6tisch/meetings/wiki/140720a_ietf90_toronto_plugfest) and [Bits-N-Bites](http://www.ietf.org/meeting/90/ietf-90-bits-n-bites.html) at Toronto).

Note: this is a personnal contribution: real IoT-LAB tools are can be
found on main [FIT IoT-LaB site](https://www.iot-lab.info),
on FIT IoT-LAB [github site](https://github.com/iot-lab/iot-lab)
and [wiki](https://github.com/iot-lab/iot-lab). This is *work in progress*.
